DayZ Server Monitor lets you view the current player count on any running DayZ
server. By default, your current/last played server is shown.

The player information updates once per minute and whenever you change servers.
DayZ Server Monitor determines your current/last played server by reading your
DayZ profile file, so it needs to run on the same computer that runs the game.
