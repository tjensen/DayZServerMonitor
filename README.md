# DayZ Server Monitor

DayZ Server Monitor lets you view the current player count on the most recently
played DayZ server.

The player information updates once per minute and whenever you change servers.
DayZ Server Monitor determines your current/last played server by reading your
DayZ profile file, so it needs to run on the same computer that runs the game.
